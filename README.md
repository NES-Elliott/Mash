# Mash: Your one stop intersection to video game knowledge

## Getting Start
This ReadMe will serve the purpose of telling you a bit about what this application is, what it does and what it will be in the future.

I know I can't be the only one who finds an interesting game and wants to know more about it, but hates going to 5-7 different locations just to pick at the information. I'll go to youtube and start searching videos, reddit looking for articles, maybe the twitter to see what is coming up next, but that just isn't efficient. I wouldn't mind loading up the webpages, but searching for them is a bit of a pain...

### ... In Comes Mash

Mash is your guide anything gaming. With mash, you can find anything from news articles from your favorite gaming news sites to twitch streamers playing the game you're looking for. There are honestly so many different features to this application, explaining it hear would be pages and pages of info. So head over to [Mash](https://nes-elliott.github.io/Mash/ "Check out Mash!") and check it out for yourself!

### Features Mash offers

#### Find games from genres or platforms you enjoy.
#### Search up a game by it's name.
#### Games will have their twitter developers, gameplay video, news articles, amazon link, pretty much anything related linked to it on one page for the user.

### Future Features

Currently, Mash is using the IGDB-api to retrieve information from their database, and display it to the user and using certain keywords to find other content around the internet for the game. This isn't how I would like it work for the future. In the future, I would like Mash to be independent! Mash will scrape the web to find it's results and push it into a database. A current issue with Mash is that, when using the application, we often get rate limited by IGDB for pinging their database so often. It's annoying to deal with, but also it limits what we can actually do for our user, which is not good at all. By eliminating the need for the IGDB-api, we display as much information to the user as they want, whenever they want it! That's our goal for the future.

So look out for Mash 2.0!!!
